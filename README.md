# ✍️ About 
🏗 Declarative & Chainable `Auto Layout` constraints made super easy. You don't even need to remember any new types to work with - the only thing that you need to do is to call `constrait` property for any of your `UIView` related classes. Then choose one or several chainable methods in order to describe `Auto Layout` constraints programmtically.
